# HTML FORM PRACTICE

This project is part of my journey learning GIT, GITHUB and Web development.
Also learning a basic HTML form and image asseta, to practice:

<Initializing a GIT repository>
<Adding and Commiting files>
<Pushing to GITHUB>

## What's Inside

${`index.html`}: A simple form with accessible labels and checkboxes
`/images/gallery/`: Royalty-free cat images used for layout practice

### Why I made this

To understand how Git works, how to manage files properly and to see my code live online.
This is a learning sandbox - not a polished product - and I'm progressing so far.

#### Next Steps

Add "CSS' styling
Explore "JavaScript" interactivity
Try deploying with "GITHUB" Pages
